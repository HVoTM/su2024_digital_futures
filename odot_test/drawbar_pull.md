Test Plan for Drawbar Pull on Wheelchair Robot (RIm pull?)
Objective:

To determine the maximum drawbar pull capacity of the wheelchair robot under various conditions.
Data Required:

    Robot Specifications:
        Maximum torque output of motors
        Wheel diameter
        Gear ratio
        Maximum power consumption

    Testing Conditions:
        Surface type (e.g., concrete, carpet)
        Incline angle (if applicable)
        Load variations (if applicable)

Methods:

    Setup:
        Ensure the wheelchair robot is fully operational and calibrated.
        Attach a load cell or dynamometer to the wheelchair's drawbar hitch securely.

    Procedure:

    Case 1: Baseline Measurement
        Objective: Establish baseline drawbar pull without any additional load.
        Steps:
            Measure the weight of the wheelchair robot itself.
            Conduct initial tests on a flat surface without any additional load to establish baseline data.

    Case 2: Incremental Load Testing
        Objective: Measure drawbar pull capacity under increasing loads.
        Steps:
            Gradually increase the load attached to the wheelchair's drawbar in predetermined increments (e.g., 10 kg steps).
            For each increment, record:
                Applied load (in kilograms)
                Drawbar pull force (in Newtons or pounds-force) measured by the load cell or dynamometer
                Wheelchair's response (e.g., motor speed, power consumption)

    Case 3: Surface Variation Testing
        Objective: Assess how different surface types affect drawbar pull.
        Steps:
            Repeat the incremental load tests on different surfaces (e.g., carpet, concrete).
            Measure and compare drawbar pull under each surface condition.

    Case 4: Incline Testing (if applicable)
        Objective: Evaluate drawbar pull on inclines.
        Steps:
            Test the wheelchair on inclines with varying angles (e.g., 5°, 10°).
            Measure drawbar pull and observe wheelchair performance uphill.

Data Collection:

    Record all data in a structured format, including:
        Test conditions (surface type, incline angle)
        Applied load and resulting drawbar pull force
        Wheelchair's performance metrics (e.g., motor current, speed)

Deliverables:

    Test Results:
        Detailed report summarizing drawbar pull capacity under various conditions.
        Graphical representation of data (e.g., load vs. pull force, performance vs. load) for clear visualization.

    Recommendations:
        Based on test results, provide recommendations for operational limits and potential improvements if applicable.

Safety Considerations:

    Ensure safety protocols are followed during testing, especially when dealing with heavy loads or dynamic movements.
    Securely fasten all test equipment to prevent accidents.

Validation:

    Verify the accuracy of measurements through repeat tests and calibration of equipment before and after testing.

Timeline:

    Define a timeline for testing phases, data analysis, and report preparation.

Risks:

    Identify potential risks such as equipment failure, instability of the wheelchair under load, or inaccuracies in data measurement.

Approval:

    Ensure the test plan is reviewed and approved by relevant stakeholders (e.g., engineers, project managers) before execution.
