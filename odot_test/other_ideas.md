# Obstacle Negotiation:

Objective: Evaluate the wheelchair's ability to navigate over various obstacles.

Method: Place obstacles of different heights and shapes (e.g., ramps, bumps) on the test path. Measure the wheelchair's ability to negotiate these obstacles without getting stuck or losing stability.

# Turning Radius and Maneuverability:
- Will be affecting with pose estimation, line following, traversing in general, obstacle avoidance

Objective: Assess the wheelchair's turning capabilities and overall maneuverability.

Method: Conduct tests to measure the minimum turning radius in both open spaces and confined areas. Evaluate the wheelchair's ability to perform sharp turns and maneuver through narrow passages.

# Battery Life and Endurance:

Objective: Determine the wheelchair's operational endurance and battery life under typical usage conditions.
    
Method: Conduct controlled tests to measure how long the wheelchair can operate continuously on a single battery charge. Include tests with varying speeds, terrains, and loads to simulate real-world usage scenarios.

- Get back to 'home' whenever battery depleted

# Safety Features Testing:

Objective: Validate the functionality of safety features such as collision avoidance, emergency stop, and obstacle detection.
    
Method: Test each safety feature individually and in combination with different operational modes. Evaluate response times and effectiveness in preventing collisions or accidents.

# Durability and Reliability:

Objective: Assess the wheelchair's durability and reliability over extended use.
    
Method: Conduct reliability tests to simulate long-term usage conditions, including exposure to varying environmental factors (e.g., temperature, humidity) and mechanical stress. Monitor performance metrics such as wear and tear on components.

# User Interface and Accessibility Testing:

Objective: Evaluate the usability and accessibility of the wheelchair's control interface.
    
Method: Conduct usability tests with different user profiles to assess the clarity, intuitiveness, and accessibility of controls (e.g., joystick, touch screen). Evaluate ease of operation and user satisfaction.

# Emergency Situations Simulation:

Objective: Test the wheelchair's response in emergency situations, such as sudden stops or power failures.
    
Method: Simulate emergency scenarios (e.g., loss of power, obstacle blocking path) and evaluate how the wheelchair responds. Measure safety protocols activation (e.g., emergency braking) and recovery procedures.

# Communication and Connectivity Testing:

Objective: Verify the reliability and performance of communication systems (e.g., wireless connectivity) used for remote operation or data exchange.

Method: Test communication range, signal strength, and data transfer rates in various environments. Ensure robustness against interference and latency issues.
